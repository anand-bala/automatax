# Differentiable Automata in [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax)

This project implements differentiable automata in JAX.
Specifically, it does so by defining _matrix operators_ on the automata transitions,
which can then be interpreted over a semiring to yield various acceptance and weighted
semantics.
